# Xtreme 10.0 - Counting Molecules

Your task is to count the number of molecules in a cup of soda which contains distilled water, carbon dioxide, and glucose. You have a machine that counts the number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a given sample.

### Input Format

The input consists of a single line with three space separated integers: <code>c</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>o</code>, where:

* <code>c</code> is the count of carbon atoms.
* <code>h</code> is the count of hydrogen atoms.
* <code>o</code> is the count of oxygen atoms.

### Constraints

0 â‰¤ <code>c</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>o</code> < 10^10

### Output Format

If the number of atoms is consistent with a mixture containing only water, carbon dioxide, and glucose molecules, the output should consist of a single line containing three space separated integers: the number of water molecules, the number of carbon dioxide molecules, and the number of glucose molecules.

If the number of atoms is not consistent with a mixture containing only water, carbon dioxide, and glucose molecules, the output should consist of a line containing the word <code>Error</code>.

### Sample Input

```
10 0 20
```

### Sample Output

```
0 10 0
```

### Explanation

The input indicates that there are 10 carbon atoms and 20 oxygen atoms. The only way that this could occur would be if there were 0 water molecules, 10 carbon dioxide molecules, and 0 glucose molecules.
