# Xtreme10.0 - Painter's Dilemma

Bob just got his first job as a house painter. Today, on his first day on the job, he has to paint a number of walls.

For those of you that have done some house painting before, you know that this is no easy task. Each wall has to be painted in multiple rounds, possibly with a different color of paint each time, and there needs to be sufficient time of waiting between consecutive rounds for the paint to dry.

To make optimal use of their time, house painters usually paint walls while waiting for other walls to dry, and hence interleave the rounds of painting different walls. But this also brings up another challenge for the painters: different walls may require different colors of paint, so they might have to replace the color on one of their paint brushes before painting that wall. But this requires washing the paint brush, waiting for it to dry, and then applying the new paint to the brush, all of which takes precious time.

The more experienced house painters circumvent the issue by bringing a lot of paint brushes. But Bob is not that fortunate, and only has two paint brushes!

Given a sequence of colors $c\_1, c\_2, â€¦, c\_N$ that Bob needs, in the order that he needs them, can you help him determine the minimum number of times he needs to change the color of one of his brushes? Both of his brushes will have no color to begin with.

Bob may ask you to compute this number for a few different scenarios, but not many. After all, he only needs to do this until he gets his first paycheck, at which point all his effort will have been worth the trouble, and he can go buy more paint brushes.
